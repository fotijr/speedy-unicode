# Speedy Unicode
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fotijr/speedy-unicode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fotijr/speedy-unicode)

A cross-platform app to quickly find unicode characters and copy them to the clipboard for use.

## Why?
Text is a widely understood and supported medium. But it can be so much more than what's easily accessible with a standard keyboard. On mobile, we have emoji keyboards. In certain apps, there is built-in emoji support (like Slack's `:<emoji>:` command). But for regular desktop usage, we have typically been limited to a QWERTY keyboard. Speedy Unicode aims to make the entire Unicode standard quickly accessible for use in any application.

## How to Use
The keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `shift` + `x` opens Speedy Unicode. Start typing to search all unicode characters. Use the arrow keys and `enter` to select a character, which is then copied to the clipboard.
