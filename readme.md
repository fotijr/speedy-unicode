ðŸš¨ â€‚**Speedy Unicode is no longer supported.** 

A mere 2 days after Speedy Unicode's first official release, I discovered this functionality already exists in Windows... ðŸ¤¦
The Windows emoji finder has been in the OS since the Creators update. Try it by focusing in any text area, and pressing `Windows Key` + `;`. Or, `Windows Key` + `.` also works.

Mac also has this functionality with `cmd` + `ctrl` + `space bar`.

# Speedy Unicode
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/o8x2kasrnghqn0wk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fotijr/speedy-unicode)

A Windows app to quickly find unicode characters and copy them to the clipboard for use.

## Why?
Text is a widely understood and supported medium. But it can be so much more than what's easily accesible with a standard keyboard. On mobile, we have emoji keyboards. In certain apps, there is built-in emoji support (like Slack's `:<emoji>:` command). But for regular desktop usage, we have typically been limited to a QWERTY keyboard. Speedy Unicode aims to make the entire Unicode standard quickly accesible for use in any application.

## How to Use
The keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `shift` + `x` opens Speedy Unicode. Start typing to search all unicode characters. Use the arrow keys and `enter` to select a character, which is then copied to the clipboard.
